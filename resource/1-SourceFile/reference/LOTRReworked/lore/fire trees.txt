As a child, my grandmother {name: lossoth_female} told me many interesting stories and legends. I still remember one of them. This is the legend of the Fire Trees.

One young man went to look for wood, because the stock of firewood of his tribe had already run out, and all the old trees had already been cut down.
The young man walked north for a day, until at night he got into a strong storm and got lost. As the last of his strength began to leave him, in the distance he saw a bright red silhouette, reminiscent of a huge burning tree. At his last gasp, the young man limped over to him and fell exhausted into the snow.

When the young man woke up, it was already a clear morning. To his surprise, he was not cold at all. Rising up, he saw in front of him a huge tree with a white trunk and fiery red leaves. Touching his bark, the young man felt a pleasant warmth all over his body. Without thinking twice, he took out an ax and began to chop down a tree. The wood was very hard and the ax quickly broke. However, the young man still managed to collect several branches and load them into his sleigh.

The young man went back, and in the evening reached the settlement of his tribe. At first, everyone was very angry with him because he brought too little wood. But as soon as one single branch was set on fire, it flared up with a bright and hot fire, which did not even think about extinguishing. The whole tribe sat down by the fire and began to watch the magic flame...
