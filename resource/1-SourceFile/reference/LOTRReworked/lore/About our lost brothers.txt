Dark magic distorted everything. Animals, trees, soil, plants, and our southern cousins ​​are no exception.

All inhabitants of the Southern Mirkwood became infected with an unknown disease. All the refugees who fled to the forest shelter died after a couple of days from this very disease. Their eyes turned green, their skin turned pale and covered with growths, and their speech became almost impossible to make out.

The doctors of our people called this disease "Guldur curse".

And when we thought that all our brothers living in the southern wild forest simply died from this disease, a terrible thing happened.

One of our scouts, who had been in the southern Mirkwood, told the terrible news.

All our brothers who fell ill with this strange disease turned out to be turned into monsters, it was impossible to name them otherwise.

Covered with growths, with clouded green eyes, with branches growing from their heads, our brothers began to serve the Necromancer.

We forestry hate the Necromancer the most in the world. And one of the reasons he hated is what he did to our brethren
