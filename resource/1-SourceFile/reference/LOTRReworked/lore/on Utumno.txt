I have often heard legends about the enigmatic Gorge of Terror, which is located in the distant Ice Mountains east of Cape Forochel. In the middle of this mountain valley was once the lair of Moorbak himself, an ancient and powerful demon. In this lair, Moorbak began to create dark creatures that became his loyal servants.

But the Great Karkhu, along with other good spirits, drove out the evil demon from there, and destroyed his lair. But, as they say, not to the end. The remains of Moorbak's lair still lie in the Gulch of Terror and, as one legend says, dark creatures still inhabit it.

In my opinion, these are just fairy tales for young children, but many really believe in the existence of this Gorge. Some daredevils even went in search of him, but most returned with nothing, and some did not return at all...
