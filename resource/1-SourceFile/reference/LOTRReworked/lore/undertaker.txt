We said goodbye on the ferry, the coachman croaked to me: 
"Near the graveyard in a decrepit house, my grandfather lives - an undertaker 
A year ago, he was led astray by an evil spirit 
His mind was shrouded in darkness 
He started throwing himself at passers-by and scaring their children. 
And mock the Valar, despise the human race 
If you come across him in the middle of the night 
Hey Eru, it's going to be hard for you." 
And in the village, there is deathly silence, as if all the people had died out 
A strange prayer can be heard from the cemetery 
From the house where the old man lives 
What is he singing about? Who is he calling? 
I accidentally discovered a stake and a cross on the ground 
What is the witchcraft secret of these ominous places? 
People were lying in coffins, as if in a coma 
The same thing in every house 
And in the village, there is deathly silence, as if all the people had died out 
A strange prayer can be heard from the cemetery 
From the house where the old man lives 
What is he singing about? Who is he calling? 
Dusk deepened, and at some moment 
My blood has run cold 
An old man hovering in the air above the cemetery 
And I heard rustling 
He said something sharply in Orcish 
The coffins opened in the semi-darkness 
He pointed his hand towards me 
And the shadows moved towards me
