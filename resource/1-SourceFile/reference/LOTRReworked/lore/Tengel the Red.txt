Oh, there once was a hero named Tengel the Red
Who came riding to Dunland from ole Westemnet
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade
As he told of bold battles and gold he had made
But then he went quiet, did Tengel the Red
When he met the chieftain Wulfgar who said
Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead
Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed
And so then came clashing and slashing of steel
As the brave man Wulfgar charged in full of zeal
And the braggart named Tengel was boastful no more
When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor
And the braggart named Tengel was boastful no more
When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor
