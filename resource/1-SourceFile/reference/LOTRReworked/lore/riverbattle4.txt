* A story from Sharku's perspective *

Sharku was very pleased, there was a lot of loot.
- Hahaha, they can't do anything to us. Run, run, we'll catch you!
* I caught a hobbit by the scruff of a hobbit and (we do not describe for your own good) *
- We'll have to send a message to others, we are not greedy ... There will be enough of them for everyone! Feast guys!
- Goth (lord), what do you order me to do? There are many of them here, but it seems to me that there will be even more of them across the river, - Ragduk approached Shark.
- Yes...? Guys, how do you like this idea?
* Growling sound of approval *
- Let's go across the river! Let's show them the taste of our scimitars!
However, they did not expect to see a dozen hobbits with bows there (Yes, yes, do not be surprised, you can read the last chapters of VK, they are also there with bows).
- Fire! shouted the sheriff of the hobbits.
- Into battle, garbage rats, into battle! - shouted Shark to the orcs, who rushed for cover.
- Give no mercy to the enemy, hobbits! - commands came from the sheriff who met Razanur. They killed a dozen orcs, but could no longer hold back their onslaught.
- Drive them, drive, snagi! - shouted Shark to the whole detachment.
- Retreat, hobbits! Let's retreat! - the sheriff commands, - now all hope is on Razanur.
- Can we catch up with them and hang them upside down? Torment them for our guys! - offered Ragduk to Sharku.
- Why? Now they will run to their little ones and tell about us. That will be merry, oh what it will be! They run, run, and we catch.
- Rhhh, let's go!
The Orcs have entered the west bank of Brandywine ...
