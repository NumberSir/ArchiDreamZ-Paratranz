I am a beekeeper and I work with bees. I want to devote this book to the basics and secrets of beekeeping.

All over our possessions are scattered numerous bee nests in which bees live. Use the empty bottle to fill your pockets with a full bottle of delicious honey. But you just need to be careful, the bees, which may not like you stealing honey from them, can fly out and start stinging you

To prevent this, you can make a fire under the hive, and then the bees will be afraid and will not fly out.

From a bottle of honey, you can then brew a delicious drink - mead. You can also drink honey itself, or bake the pride of our people - beornings honey cakes

Using scissors, it becomes possible to extract a honeycomb.

Candles are made using honeycombs and the wax that is in them.

Honey and all its derivatives can be bought from beekeepers like me who live in the villages of the Beornings.

I hope this book helped the reader on the path of beekeeping.
