The blacksmith lived in one settlement. He forged well. Many merchants of our clans came to him for axes, sharper than the teeth of dragons and armor that are stronger than our rocks and mountains.

One day the King of the Ironfists came to this blacksmith and ordered armor, and weapons for his soldiers and himself. The famous blacksmith was surprised that his king himself came to his shop. Pride for himself appeared in the heart of the master and he took the order of the king. Having agreed on the terms, the ruler of the Ironfists went to his chambers.

The blacksmith went to his warehouse and began to collect materials for forging, but noticed that he did not have enough coal for quenching. The master was desperate, he was afraid that he would not have time to forge everything in time. The blacksmith leaned on the shelf, and there were tin billets lying on it. The shelf broke and the blanks fell into the blacksmith's crucible. The gnome corrected the shelf and began to pour the damaged alloy into the mold for the gwod. As the blacksmith began to forge nails, he noticed that the alloy turned out to be strong. The master decided to buy more tin, and began to create armor and ax handles from a wonderful alloy.

It's time to hand over the order to the King. He took the armor and axes from the blacksmith. He was amazed by the strength of the master's products and paid twice as much as he promised. Since then, the master began to use tin for his creations, and also shared this knowledge with other blacksmiths. This is how the recipe for making Orocarni Steel appeared.
