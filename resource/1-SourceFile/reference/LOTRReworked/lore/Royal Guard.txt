When the great golden serpent Smaug fell, our great city of Dale was rebuilt. 

Together with Dale, the great dwarf underground palace - Erebor, or as we call it - the Lonely Mountain, was rebuilt and populated. 

And when the new king, Bard, came to power, it was decided to find an elite detachment of city defenders - the Royal Guard 

Having selected the strongest fighters from his people, King Bard sent them to study at the highest level of military craft from the dwarves. 

The royal guards of Erebor taught future royal guards what they themselves knew. 

And after training, the guardsmen forged their own weapons and armor from Dwarven steel, one of the strongest materials. 

And to this day, Dale's royal guards protect our city from outside threats.
