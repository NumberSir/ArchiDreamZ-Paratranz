* Story on behalf of Razanur *

Razanur has been leading the hobbits along the path for a couple of hours, many leagues have passed. They all burned with rage against the orcs, so they came to Backland very quickly.
Hardly had the evil grin left Sharku's face when she was overshadowed by a rockfall. Razanur led the militia.
- Chop them, shoot them, knock the evil out of the Shire! shouted Razanur, thrusting his dagger into the orc.
The orcs at first did not attach importance to the escapade of the hobbits. Pfft, think about it, we tried to defend ourselves, right now we'll put them in their place. But it was not there. The hobbits were filled with a rage never seen before in the Shire. They fired from bows, stabbed them with hoes and rakes, and threw stones. One stone hit Sharka and it flew off the warg. The next stone hit him in the eye.
- Archhhhh !!! Ragduk! Help me and carve out the guts of these slugs!
- I was waiting for this moment, you, Mordor rat, you need to cut out the guts!
* Ragduk plunged his scimitar into Sharku's chest a couple of times, and then, finally chopped off his head *
- Now I will decide who is to feed and who is in the pit! he yelled and ran to the east bank.
- Keep the orcs out of here! Stop it! - shouted to the archers Razanur.
The archers fired a mass at Ragduk and hit him in the back. The orc dropped dead.
Other orcs tried to follow the example of Ragduk, but they also could not retreat - more reinforcements arrived from the east bank.
The Hobbits buried all the dead hobbits at the Brandywine Bridge, and now this event will be listed as "River Carnage". Razanur Took was promoted to sheriff and served for the benefit of the Shire. However, the story doesn't end there ...

Once, Razanur was frying fish for dinner, and someone knocked on his door. He hurried to open the door and saw an old man with a blue beard and blue hat.
- Hello my friend. You are Razanur Tuk, I believe correctly?
- Yes, do you have something important? My fish burns there.
- Very, very important. I'm looking for someone to travel east.
Razanur remembered the story of Bilbo and pondered, but he remembered too much the orcs, which made all his clothes stink.
- No no no. Adventure has no place for hobbits; look across the river or in Bree. Goodbye!
