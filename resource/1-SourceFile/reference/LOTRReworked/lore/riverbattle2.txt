* A story from Sharku's perspective *

- Archkh, a week without fresh meat, one rot, and wormy bread! - said Sharku, sitting on his warg.
- Yes, yes, the meat would not hurt, - said the snaga.
- Silence, rat! But you're right, we need food and loot!
* General roar of approval *
- Ragduk! Come here, live! - shouted Sharku and stuck the map of Eriador at the orc who approached.
- Rhhh, and what should I do with her? It doesn't even burn normally, ”Ragduk grumbled.
- You will find profit for us, or you will go to feed my warg.
- Archkh, you are my dear Sharku ... They will immediately hand you over to Lagburz, they won't even leave a trace of you there!
Sharku said nothing and only patted the warg. And the warg slowly walked towards Ragduk, growling.
-Arhhh, good, good!
Sharku stopped the warg.
- And where are we going to make money?
- Let me read these scribbles! Oh, this is it! The western bank of the Br ... You can break your tongue, rrhh! I have heard stories of weak undersides on the other side.
- Nice, if everything goes well, I will personally make sure that you are not eaten, - Sharku laughed, - well, guys, let's move! Throqu pushdug globs! (We'll eat some stinking waste!)
The orcs saddled the wargs and rushed to the west under the howl. A couple of days passed, and they found the tract and the first signs of the population. A little later, they saw one undersized (hobbit), and he was immediately gone.
- Hey, Ragduk, come here, take advantage of your prey. You guided us to them!
- Archrh, how long have I eaten fresh meat!
The orc band soon reached the first hobbit settlements. How much there was a cry ...
- Hahaha, Ragduk, you definitely do not have the chance to be in a varzh belly. For now, at least ...
