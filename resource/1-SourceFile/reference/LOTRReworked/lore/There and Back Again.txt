O Mithrandir, O my Gray wanderer,
Tell me a different story.
About how the dwarves took axes,
About how they all lit the stoves.
Tell me about human courage,
About how the archer hit with an arrow
Huge dragon on the water
And it did not harm the skin in the fire.
Tell us about how Erebor was saved.
And the Arkenstone was taken away from there.
Tell me about the fearless hobbit,
Who didn't crave gold!
Was he a hero? Or not?
He would have given me an answer sooner!
O Olorin, O Gray Mage,
I'm glad to hear your words.
