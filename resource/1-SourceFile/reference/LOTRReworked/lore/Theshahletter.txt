My khan, I of course understand that I’m unlikely to be able to convince you, but still, postpone your campaign against these gnomes. None of them were successful. You are simply sending your people to certain death under the palaces of these dwarfs. We do not have time to recover losses after the last war. In addition, the Eye is asking for more and more slaves... But if you don’t come to your senses, then here is a report on the combat readiness of my army... (further sentences cannot be deciphered due to the poorly preserved paper) 

... also, about provisions. We managed to collect everything we could. Due to the drought, it was not possible to collect as much as in previous campaigns, but this should be enough. 

I'm waiting for you in Azh-Karazh. I hope you come to your senses...
