Do you want to command the knights of the North, my friend #?
These knights will follow you, but for a small price, #.
Bring me a few dozen coins, and I will give my Dúnedain under your command.
Friendship in Arnor is tight in these parts. Black trackers may track you. My knights can protect you
My kingdom's equipment is hard to find right now. That's why I need payment for this.
The Dunedain respect you, and will follow you to the complete destruction of Angmar.
The knights of Arnor will only follow a true hero. And you are exactly like that, #!
My people are the best swordsmen in all of Eriador!
I will give you several of my warriors for a decent price.
The salary is pennies, but the service is not sugar... Still people like you come here and click on me!
You are worthy to command the great Dúnedain of the North!
