Only those most devoted to the ideals of Arnor can fight alongside us in battle, #.
If you want to command my knights, then you must show loyalty to my people.
Are you by any chance a minion of Angmar, #?
Our forests are full of black trackers and I can't trust everyone I meet.
There are few of us left, and you must show your good side if you want to get my warriors.
You have not yet earned the right to command the knights of Arnor, #.
Show your loyalty, #, and then my knights will march under your banner.
You must be loyal to Arnor if you wish to command the remnants of my kingdom.
We, the warriors of Arnor, will not risk our lives for you. You must prove that you are worthy of help from the Dúnedain.
Prove that you are fighting against Angmar, and we will unite behind a common goal.
You must become famous among the Dúnedain if you want us to trust you.
Only a true friend of our people, the Dúnedain, can lead us to war.
