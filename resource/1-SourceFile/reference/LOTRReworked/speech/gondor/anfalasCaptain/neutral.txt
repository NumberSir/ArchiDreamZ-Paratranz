Only the mightiest of Gondor's friends can command my warriors, #.
If you want to command Rondalf's soldiers, you must prove that you can be trusted.
Are you a friend or an enemy, #?
I was informed that you are a friend of the people of Golasgil, however, I believe that you should not be trusted. Try to convince me.
I will not allow a commoner to command the brave warriors of Anfalas. I respect you as a person, but not as a commander.
It’s stupid to expect that I’ll just give you my people like that, #.
Prove to us that you can be trusted, #, and we will allow you to command our people. Although not free.
Want to command the Anfalas militia? To do this we need to earn the respect of our people, #.
Only a true friend of Gondor is allowed to command our people.
You need to become our strong ally if you want to hire our troops, #.
You need to do more good deeds for the Gondorian people if you want to command our people.
Prove your loyalty to the peasants of Anfalas, and they will follow you.
