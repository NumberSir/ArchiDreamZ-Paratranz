Do you want to get the warriors of Anfalas under your command, #?
My warriors are not cheap, #. You will have to shell out a small amount.
You are a good warrior, #. You can command the army of Anfalas.
Even though almost all of us are fishermen, we can stand up for ourselves and our country.
Be ready, #, to lead my warriors to war, to the east.
I heard that a large army is gathering behind the walls of the mountains of Mordor. We must be ready.
We are the guardians of the world, #. Yes, we are fishermen and herders. But we can still show our teeth to Sauron and his minions.
Rhondalf's warriors are at your service, #.
At your service.
We may not be as skilled in warfare as the warriors of Minas Tirith, but we are worth something.
