Do you want to lead the militia?
For a couple of silver coins you will get my warriors, and I can feed my family.
We are already making ends meet. So you either give me the coins or you leave.
My boys may not be good fighters, but they are great fishermen.
Do you need a militia?
My guys may be poorly equipped, but at least you wonâ€™t get hungry along the way.
If trouble begins in Gondor, then you can hire my warriors, #.
Aethyr trusts you, #. You can get our militias.
Maybe you should think again before hiring?
My family is about to starve to death and you're just clicking on me!
My warriors can distribute tasty bream to the enemies of Gondor!
JUST HIRE WARRIORS! Make your dream come true!
