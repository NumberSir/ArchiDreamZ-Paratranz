My people are fishermen, and I'm not going to give them to just anyone #.
If you want to get the militia under my control, then first prove your loyalty to my country.
Are you friend or foe, #?
Pisces whispers that you are a friend of Gondor, but I cannot be sure of this until you bring enough benefit to our kingdom.
There are few warriors in our region and I’m not going to give them to just anyone.
You brought too little benefit to our fishermen to command them, #.
So far you have only helped our fish by scaring them away.
I don’t give my strong guys to suspicious people.
Only a true friend of Gondor can lead our valiant soldiers into battle.
Show me that you are a friend of Gondor and then I will give you a couple of militia.
Do more good deeds for Gondor and then you will receive a militia. So far you've only scared away our catch
Listen, are you stupid or not? Get 150 reputation with GONDOR or more and then I'll let you hire militia.
