Need a bow and arrow? Bring me the money and we'll talk.
Welcome, #! Do you need my bow?
Arrowheads are so hard to find.
I see you are a friend of Gondor, #.
Do you want to get Blackroots's gear, #? I can do it.
I'm still looking for a student...
I am the best bow maker in our valley!
Good afternoon, #! Would you like to buy my beautiful arrows?
Welcome to Blackroot#! What can I offer you?
Ay! Something hit me on the forehead!
What do you need, #?
