You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of my Motherland!
You are a servant of our enemies, #!
Get off the lands of Blackroot!
Get out of my sight, you disgusting!
I refuse to trade with scoundrels like you, #.
I do not distribute my arrows to the slaves of darkness! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Freaks of Mordor! How dare you enter our valley?
Our brave archers will quickly finish you off!
I won't give you anything, #!
