Hello, #! Have you come for my harvest?
I offer you the best vegetables of the East!
The coastal lands are very fertile.
All these lands near the sea are well suited for growing vegetables.
My employees work tirelessly.
My employees are very hardworking, #. you can hire them and they will make Your garden look divine.
I work hard to fulfill the orders of our masters.
Our rulers have ordered us to increase the fields, to make the workers work harder, to work harder. They need food to feed their troops.
My summer residents are working hard, #. We need to feed our army!
I offer my harvest with money. And my prices are fair.
If you have hoes, buckets, or anything else that might be useful for farming, say so. I'll buy it from You.
I have a lot of men and women looking for work, #.
The air and soil are good here; it's good for farming.
The soil of this country is perfect for growing crops.
