Villains like you have no place among us.
The friends of Gondor are our enemies!
I'll beat you with my hoe!
You're not my friend, #.
Leave these lands immediately!
I don't want anything to do with you!
Such people are not welcome here!
Get off me,#!
Away, friend of Gondor!
Guards! Guards! That duck tried to steal my crop!
Thief! Enemy! Clean up, #.
