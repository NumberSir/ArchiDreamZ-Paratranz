I will not trade with You!

You are not welcome here, #!
Get away, servant of Gondor!
Go away, #. I won't trade with you!
May the guards cut me down if I ever do anything stupid and sell anything to a gondorianist!
Get out, Gondor!

Go back to your shithole, run to the West!
No, #. I'm not interested in trading with You!
