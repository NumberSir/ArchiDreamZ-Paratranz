I can't trade with You, #. Sorry.
The lords of Khand would be angry with me if I equipped an outsider with our armor.
I'm sorry, #, but You'll have to find your armor somewhere else. I won't sell You anything.
Blacksmithing is a noble craft. And what is created thanks to this craft should only go to the worthy.
I don't believe You can bring honor and glory to my forge.
I'm sorry, but I won't even give you my weapons for money, #. How do I know You'll use them for good?
I only sell my goods to noble people.
I've never heard of you, warrior from the West. How do I know you won't turn my own weapon against my family?
Words are just empty sounds. You must prove that you want to protect my people.
We're not stupid enough to believe outsiders,#.
Are you fighting for us,#, or for the White Tree?
I have not heard of You, #. I sell my weapons only to the true heroes whose name our bards sing in their ballads.
Prove to me that You can be trusted before I give You my services.
When my people call Your name with tears of happiness in their eyes, #, I will trade with You.
