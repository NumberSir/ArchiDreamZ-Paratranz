Welcome to my forge, #!
I forge the best armor in the East.
You will need this armor when you go to fight for the Great Eye.
The Great Eye demands that you buy armor from me!
Welcome, #. What can I offer You?
Do you like my work?
The armor of my work will take away all daggers and stop arrows!
Good armor is very expensive, #, but if you have enough money, I'll make it for you.
In the entire West, there is no one equal to us in blacksmithing skills!
One of my blades could have saved Your life.
My friend, I can make you the best armor in the world!
Only a few have reached the highest level in blacksmithing. I'm one of those hard workers.
I would be happy if you were safe all the time, my friend. And this is only possible in my armor.
Welcome, #! Do you need weapons or armor?
Ah, Khandish steel. Nothing holds a sharpener like the steel of my people. Tough as dragon scales, light as a feather!
Welcome, #. Glad to see You in my forge.
The whole school went to war, #, and I was left without a student!
Any sword of mine will cut the breastplate of Gondor at the first blow!
Now it's hard to find good steel. The best materials have already been spent on military campaigns.
I have heard stories of Your deeds, #, and it would be a great honor to equip You.
You can run through all the villages and towns of Rohan and Gondor, but you can't find a better blacksmith than me.
Helmets, Breastplates, and swords are all yours, my friend, if you have money.
Welcome to my forge, #. Our people are preparing for war, so I have to work day and night.
Thousands of people need a new sword or armor, #. But I think I can spare the time for You.
