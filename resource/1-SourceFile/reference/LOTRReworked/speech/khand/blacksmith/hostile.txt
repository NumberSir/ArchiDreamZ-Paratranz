Get out!
You are the enemy of our people!
Away, #! I don't want to deal with You!
I wouldn't give you a lousy blade if you paid a chest of gold for it!
I don't want to see the sword of my work in the hands of a rat from the West. You won't get it!
You have no honor, #!
You are not our friend!
Blacksmithing of my people is the highest art! And you are not worthy of it!
