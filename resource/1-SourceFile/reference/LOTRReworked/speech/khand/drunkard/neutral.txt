Uh, who are you? Who am I? I'll probably go...
From my wife will fly exactly *ik*. Exactly *ik* will fly in.
When I'm drunk, I feel like talking. Tell us about yourself, #.
I just had a little booze and got carried away.
Just give me a sword in my hand, and I will conquer all of Gondor alone!
Will you please have a drink with me?
Vodka is good, but kumis is better. I know it myself.
That's when I was young...
sorry, I got lost, Ah well, I'll lie down here. Good night
A cup of kumis and I'm ready to go camping.
Oh Oh Oh, I'm falling, help me, Wayfarer!
Khand *ik*, this is a very *ik* harsh land. But we are very friendly. As you can see. *ik*
I got really drunk, I need to stop drinking....
ik-ik, wow, so it's you, #!
After I drink a lot, I'm hallucinating. It seems as if the ocean overflowed in the middle of the desert
I have to stop drinking, or I'm already starting to see a warrior dressed in strange silver armor and carrying a Mace
To your health, #! the
Mug is empty, so it's time to pour another One!
