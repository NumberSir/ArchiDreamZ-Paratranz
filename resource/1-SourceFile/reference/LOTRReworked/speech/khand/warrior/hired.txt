To The Dark Lord!
Crush your enemies like dust!
Take no prisoners!
I am proud to fight with you, #
Let's bring chaos and death to the people of the White Fortress!
Haha, our anger burns us like the flames of orcs!
We are carried into battle by our anger!
First, we will go through them with our blades, and then trample them with our cavalry!
Release the guts of the enemies of Sauron!
I only hate two things: People from the lands of the White Fortress, and stand idle when I can get a good fight!
Death! Death! Death!
Anger is our guiding star!
Lead us into battle,#!
Skulls! Bones! Skulls!
Kill them all!
We will bring our hammers down on them!
