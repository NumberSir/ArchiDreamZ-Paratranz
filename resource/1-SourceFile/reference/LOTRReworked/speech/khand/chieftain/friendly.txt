My people serve You and the Great Eye
I've only seen a couple of great warriors in my life. But I've never met anyone as fierce as you!
You're a good warrior, #. I think you could lead an entire army. 
We do not like orcs, they are cruel, they do not know mercy. We try to keep up with them. But you, you're a terrible opponent. 
I wouldn't want to face you in a duel. I'm glad you're fighting for Sauron.
South of the Shadow Mountains, our warriors are the best. And you #. I think you're ready to be in charge of them.
Gondor, a miserable Kingdom. But never mind, it won't be long. Lead our troops to war, #!
Horse breeders, elves, dunedain. They're just a bunch of scum. The army under your command will do more than all of them combined.
The Dark Lord calls you,#. you are ready! Lead your army into battle. Bring us victory in the war.
I give you permission to command this army.
Your exploits are legendary.
Sauron speaks well of you, #.
