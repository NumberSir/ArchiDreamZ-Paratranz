Hm. Do you really think I'd trust you with my guys? You are deeply mistaken. Go and prove your loyalty to Khand.
I don't trust you.
Go and kill at least a gondorian.
You look frail.
I don't see any gondorian blood on your sword.
I have orders from Sauron not to give warriors to squishy people like you.
Hahaha, don't be ridiculous. I'd rather trust a child with my troops than you.
No, no, no. Even think. They'll laugh at me.
Fail. We don't need such weaklings.
I'm sorry, but you'd better go and serve our cause first. Then I'll give you troops.
I distrust my warriors, even Haradrim. And they are our allies. What's there to think about a crook, and even from the West. Absurd!
I don't think you can even cut off a chicken's head.
Aren't you serving the little Easterners? Suspicious...
Come on, get lost. I'm in a hurry. I won't even talk to you, it's a waste of time.
