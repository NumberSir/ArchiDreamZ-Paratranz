Hello, #
Have you heard from the Easterlings?
We have been preparing for war in full swing lately
We hate the White Fortress people with all our heart
Soon the White Fortress will fall!
The people of the White Fortress are our old enemies,#.
For many years we cannot forget how the people of the White Fortress killed our Great Khan Azad-Aur.
Our past is forgotten, our future is unknown, and that is why we live in the present
Let's have a cup of kumis, # 
We, Variags, warlike people, and therefore, all our enemies are not big trouble!
Anger is our guiding star
As the legends say, our ancestors saw a huge star fall into The Khand desert, and taking this as a sign, they settled here, where we live to this day.
Some people confuse us with the Easterlings, although we are an absolutely different people, with our own ancient history and culture
You have certainly come for a purpose, traveler, because no one will wander into the dangerous Sands of Khand for nothing.
My father was once led by the road of adventure,#. But then he was shot in the knee by the devil's horse breeders from the lands behind the White Fortress.
We serve the Dark Lord faithfully!
We don't know much about the land beyond the White Fortress. All we know is that there are disgusting, filthy, straw-headed horse breeders there, whom we call " horse-lovers." It feels like they're sleeping in the stables with their horses.
We know a lot more about the land beyond Khand than we do about the land beyond the White Fortress.
I heard a story about a certain Minastir who wanted to relieve himself so badly that he forgot to take off his armor and fell into the river where he was going to urinate. That's hilarious!
Lately, I often feel like I'm being watched by a figure holding a huge Mace
Hey,#, would you like to have a cup of kumis with me at the Inn?
We don't trust strangers, but you look extremely friendly
It's been a while since I trained with my favorite sword. It's time to correct this misunderstanding.
