You are a great warrior, #.
Nice frosty day. A great day for a war against the King's traitors.
Are you an orc? Well, you can have my guys in control.
For the glory of Angmar!
How are you doing, #? Orcs aren't too annoying? They are unpleasant, but we have a common goal.
Glory to the Witch-King!
An army gathers in Karn-Dum. Soon the West will fall.
I think with your merits you will be accepted as the commander of Minas Eldanarion.
Our ancestors long ago sided with Sauron. The Rangers are descendants of traitors. Help us crush them.
The Rangers will fall!
The Kingdom of Angmar will be reborn!
Destroy the traitors from the forests of Eriador.
I've been to many wars. The Rangers are weak, believe me.
Crush our enemies, #!
