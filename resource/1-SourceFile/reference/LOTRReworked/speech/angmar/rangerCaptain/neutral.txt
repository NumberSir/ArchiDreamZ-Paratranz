Only the most loyal friends of the true Dunedain can fight with us side by side, #.
If you want to command the troops of the pathfinders of Angmar, you must justify our trust.
Are you a friend or an enemy, #?
Many say that you are a friend of the true dunedain, but I will believe it only when I can verify it personally. As the saying goes: "It's better to see once than hear a hundred times."
You must become famous among the Witch-King's people to command my people.
We don't trust you enough yet to follow you.
Prove to us that you can be trusted, #, and we will fight with you.
The pathfinders of Angmar are worried about the future of Gondor. And that's why they don't risk believing everyone, they don't follow every upstart. Only a renowned warrior of Angmar can lead them into battle.
