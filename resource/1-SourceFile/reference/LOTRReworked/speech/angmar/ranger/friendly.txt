The Rangers are not our rivals.
We protect these lands from the local "guards" - traitors.
Our bows are strong!
Take your bow, #. We are going to war!
Death to traitors from the south.
There is no place in Eriador for traitors to the King!
The cold of the North will destroy our enemies.
Elves and The Rangers. They will all fall to the army of the Iron Crown.
I have been protecting these lands from saboteurs for quite some time. I've seen a lot of blood, #.
Glory to the Iron Crown!
We serve Sauron and the Witch-King.
I know every path, every branch here. Not a single elf will pass me by.
We are known for being secretive. We will immediately notice the enemy.
We are fighting for what is right, #. It's so good that you are with us.
Our time has come, it is time to crush our enemies.
