Your death will be quick, #!
I will finish you!
You are not welcome here!
Get away from our land, scoundrel!
You are the enemy of the descendants of Numenor, #!
What madness brought you here?
You can't pass!
Get your dirty paws off our land, #!
Don't underestimate us, traitor.
Get away from our lands, elven spy!
Death to the enemies of Angmar, which means you will die now!
You have set foot in the lands of the North for the last time!
Your death will be as quick as an arrow!
Don't you think you can escape, #? I am the shadow itself!
Death to the enemies of the Witch-King!
