Sorry, but I don't know you at all and I won't trade with you.
Welcome to our lands.
Do you want to buy equipment? Sorry, but I don’t trade with everyone I meet.
I welcome you to our lands, #.
Glorify your name in our area, and only after that I will be able to sell you equipment.
I don't trust you enough to trade with you.
I cannot be sure that you are not a savage from the forests of Eriador.
I trade only with those whom my people and the Witch-King respect.
Prove that you can be trusted, and then I will agree to trade with you.
You're bothering me, #.
Are you a friend of the North or its enemy?
Are you a friend of the true Dúnedain, #?
I trade only with true friends, #.
I don't trade with everyone I meet...
You must prove your loyalty to the true Dúnedain if you wish to trade with me.
I don’t trust you enough to give you my goods, even for money. I trade only with our allies.
Show yourself as a great warrior, as a defender of our great people, and then we will make a deal.
How can I be sure that you are not from the valley of the elves or the forests of Eriador? Now you buy a sword from me, and then you will slaughter the entire village.
