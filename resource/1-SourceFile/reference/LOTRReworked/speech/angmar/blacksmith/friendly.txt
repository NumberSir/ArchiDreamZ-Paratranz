Do you need equipment? Just bring me some coins.
Welcome, #! What can I do for you?
I barely have enough materials to fill orders.
Are you a friend of the North, #?
Do you want a handmade blade, #?
Do you need armor? Our world is dangerous, we cannot do without them.
I'm still looking for a student...
I forge the best weapons in the North!
We have preserved the knowledge of our ancestors about hardening and forging steel, #. We create excellent blades and excellent armor.
In Numenor they made beautiful helmets and the strongest armor! I achieved even more.
Good afternoon, #! Are you here to get your equipment?
Welcome to the North, #! What can I offer you?
These are difficult times... materials are now rare and expensive.
What do you need, #?
What brings you to our wasteland, #?
Be on your guard, #. These parts are full of enemies.
Not everyone weakens under the yoke of years - the earth preserves the roots.
The skill of the Numenoreans has been lost, but I have learned to make helmets that are not inferior to them in quality.
