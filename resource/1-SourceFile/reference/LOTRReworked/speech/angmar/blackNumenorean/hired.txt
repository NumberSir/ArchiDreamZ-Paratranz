Let's burn their villages to the ground!
We are fighting for you, #!
We need the blood of infidels!
To battle!
You are a mighty warrior, #! In the ancient times of Numenor you were held in high esteem.
I'll crush their heads!
Let's move out, #? I can't wait for the battle!
The thunder of battles will come!
Your enemies are our enemies, #!
Let us stain the earth with the blood of the rangers!
I'm hungry for battle!
There are scars to be had in this battle.
You are a great warrior, #. Lead us to victory.
For Numenor! For Angmar!
I await your orders, commander.
I obey, captain #!
For the Iron Crown!
Sauron is the ruler of the world. And the elves and rangers will burn in the fire of war!
