It would be great to go into battle with you, #.
Soon Angmar will rise from its knees!
I cut off so many heads in battles... How many are on your account, #?
What you need?
Soon Angmar will rule all of Middle-earth, and the lands of the infidels will burn in fire!
Loyal dirty traitors... They betrayed King Ar-Pharazon in the past. But we will take revenge on them in the present.
Welcome to our lands, #!
Warriors like you are welcome in these lands.
The Rangers are cowards. They hide in the bushes, cowardly shoot from a bow, from an ambush. We, the true Numenoreans, go into battle with proud chests.
Are you for the true Numenoreans, #?
You are a great warrior, #!
The blood of traitors will soon be shed.
Are you on our side, #?
We are glad that you are an enemy of the DÃºnedain rangers, #.
Death to traitors!
Death to the enemies of the Witch-King!
Isn't it time to shed the blood of the infidels, #?
If you are the enemy of the Rangers, then you are our friend.
I hope the traitors from the plains didn't lie about us? They can do it.
Traitors have a chance at redemption, #. All they have to do is get on the right path.
