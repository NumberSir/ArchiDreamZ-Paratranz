I'll break your face!
Die, the Rangers Spy!
Who are you? Get out of here!
I'll crush your skull!
Run, run while you can!
You are the enemy of Angmar. These are the first to die!
You'll die faster than you can blink an eye, #!
I'll break your legs, and you won't run away anywhere else!
Your pathetic ancestors will not hear you calling for help!
Death to you and your families!
I'll tear you up like a rabbit!
I will roast you in the flames of Angmar!
What the...? The Rangers?!
Only the friends of Angmar may approach us, #!
Die, #!
Die!
I would rather hear your cries of pain!
Soon you will scream, spy of the infidels!
For Numenor! Die!
It’s a pity that you became a hostage to the Rangers’s lies. You will die for your stupidity.
Run! As long as I'm merciful.
Our armor is strong, our spirit is strong. How strong is your faith in the lies of traitors?
