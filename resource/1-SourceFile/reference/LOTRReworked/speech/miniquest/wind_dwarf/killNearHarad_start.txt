You've been to the South, #? I was there once. The people of those places were very unfriendly to me when they found out that I was from the Wind Mountains. They favor only traitors Blacklocks. Well, we'll get to these stumblers yet. In the meantime, deal with the southerners. Kill $ and get a reward.
