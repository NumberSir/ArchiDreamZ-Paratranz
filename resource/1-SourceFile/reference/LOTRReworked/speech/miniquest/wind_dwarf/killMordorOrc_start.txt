I see you're a great warrior, #! Well, we'll check it out now. You must have heard of Mordor. There are many scary creatures living there. But the most vile are the orcs. They have no concept of honor, dignity, or mercy. We have been at war with them for a long time. However, there is a lull now. They don't go that far East. But this does not mean that we should sit idly by. Go to the West. Prove your prowess! Kill them and you will be rewarded for your actions.
