Hello, traveler. Oh, I see you from far away lands. News takes a long time to reach us. We don't know anything about the balance of power, but I do know one thing. The spawn of Mordor do not sleep idle. I've heard from my Red Mountain cousins about new types of orcs that aren't afraid of the sun. They are stronger and higher. Reduce their population,#. Go and kill $. You will receive a generous reward.
