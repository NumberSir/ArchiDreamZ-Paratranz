Have you ever heard of people living up North? They are cruel and merciless. We never did business with them. And we don't want to, because they serve Him. We hate the minions of Sauron. I hope you do, too, so go, #, break a couple of easterling skulls. Kill $. the Reward will not be long in coming, believe me.
