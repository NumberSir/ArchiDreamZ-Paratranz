When the DÃºnedain first arrived, we were amazed at the quality of their equipment. Of course, we know how to make good weapons and tools out of bone and stone. But it is in no way comparable to the glittering metal wares used by the peoples south of Forodwaith. One of our artisans got it into his head that if he had $, he could learn how to make iron products. I doubt that he will succeed, but he promised to pay well. If you can bring me everything I need, I will gladly share this money with you.
