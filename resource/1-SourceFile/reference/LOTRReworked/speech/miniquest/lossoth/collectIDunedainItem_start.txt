We still remember our friendship with Arnor's people, #. Some say they completely disappeared after the war with the Iron King, but I know they are not. Bring me $ from the DÃºnedain and I will reward you handsomely!
Our elders often tell legends about strange people who took refuge with us from the sorcerer from Angmar long ago. Tall, clad in shining armor and armed with sharp blades and long bows, they were like real gods! How happy I would be if I saw with my own eyes the people of Arnor and their magnificent craft! They say you are friends with their descendants, #. If you bring me $, I will be your eternal debtor!
