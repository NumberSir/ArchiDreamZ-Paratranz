The polar bear is the strong and mighty beast Forodwaith. We moose hunt these sacred animals for more than just meat and skins. Polar bear hunting is our tradition. Each of our young men must defeat the bear with only a spear, or he will never become a man. I have heard that you are a skilled warrior,#, so I offer you a challenge-kill $! If you can do it, I'll tell my entire tribe about your feat, and I'll pay you back!"
