Times are harsh for our people, #. Every year, winters are getting colder and there is less food. The Iron King was defeated many years ago, but evil is again approaching our lands. I even heard that a treacherous servant of Darkness named $ has sneaked into our land, and not at all for good purposes. Many of our brave warriors have died trying to stop him. We mustn't leave it like that! They say you are a mighty warrior, #. So show this rascal the power of the Lossoth! Kill $ and get gratitude from all our people.
