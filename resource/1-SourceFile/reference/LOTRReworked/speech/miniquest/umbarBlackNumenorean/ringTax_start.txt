The princes of Ain-an-Ahar are becoming more and more greedy, and every month they demand more and more taxes! Now they demand that all our people give up any precious rings they own. For what purpose, I cannot imagine. I'm really poor and don't have these things, but if they think I'm hiding something... oh dear #, if you bring me $, you'll just save me!
