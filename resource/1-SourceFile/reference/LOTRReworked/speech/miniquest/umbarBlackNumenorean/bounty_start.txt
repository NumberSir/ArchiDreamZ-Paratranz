Where are you, #! The Gondorians have sent a warrior into our lands, and he is killing our people! They call him $, his name be damned! Kill our enemy, for he has killed many of my brothers!
Hey, you're a #, right? People claim that you are good with a scimitar. There is a northerner whose death I wish, his name is $. Gondorian scum. Kill this villain and you will be richly rewarded!
Hello, #. I have an offer for you that you cannot refuse. A scoundrel named $ has entered our lands, whom Gondor sent here to undermine our morale. This villain must die. Our people will be very grateful to you, # and besides, I will pay well.
