Oh, Gondor. The people of this kingdom are weak and full of stupidity. And yet they consider themselves the heirs of Adanude! This is wrong, #. We Umbarians remember the coming of Ar-Pharazon; We remember the great leaders - Herumor and Fuinur. And if you kill $ in battle, then the northern fools will also remember them. Go, then, to the glory of Umbar!
