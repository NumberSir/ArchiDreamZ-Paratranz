My friend, are you not coping with your tasks? I don't accept your offer of help.
You're already busy, #. It would be awkward for me to burden you with even more requests.
I appreciate your offer, #, but you must remember the promises you made to others...
Go and help others before you offer to help me.
We, the People of the Desert, remember the promises made to others, #. Don't come to me until you help the others.
I can't accept your help - you already have so many tasks.
Would you like to help others before you come to me, #?
Thank you for the offer, #, but I see that you are already busy.
You are definitely too busy to do what I want to ask you to do.
A promise to help is by no means a trifle, #. Go and help those who asked you for help.
Are you busy, #. I see this, and I will not ask you for anything.
I’m not used to loading a camel, which is already fully loaded, and therefore I won’t even ask to help me.
