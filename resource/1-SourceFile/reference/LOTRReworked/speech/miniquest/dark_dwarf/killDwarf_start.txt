Durin's Folk. Yes, everyone has heard about this folk. We used to be with friends, but then they betrayed someone who was generous with them. They refused gifts that no one could offer them. They make up almost legends about the Kingdom of Erebor. #, I don't think it's as big as they say, but you can't underestimate the enemy. Help us in this war and we will reward you. Cut off their heads $ and you will receive a generous reward.
