Oh, #. I hope you're a good warrior. Run my errand. Have you heard of Dale? The Kingdom at the foot of Erebor. These nasty little people are helping our enemies, the dwarves of Durin's Folk. Impostors who make up legends. Undeservedly composed. Line up the ranks, these minions of the filthy Erebor rats. Kill $ and I'll reward you.
