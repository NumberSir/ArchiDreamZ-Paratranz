#, you have already decided to help many people. Come back to me as you complete all your tasks
You already have a lot of tasks, #
I never thought that a person would ask for more tasks when he has so many unfinished ones!
Strange things, #. You want to help me, but you promised to help more people? Help them to begin with.
Come back when you do everything you want
I appreciate your willingness to help, but please complete all your old assignments.
