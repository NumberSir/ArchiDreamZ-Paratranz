Ancient burial mounds are hidden in the dark lands of Dol Guldur, #. And according to what I know, terrible things are happening there. The bodies of the dead warriors - orcs, humans and even elves, rise again to replenish the army of the Necromancer. It is very dangerous, but if you are not afraid to go to the crypts and make the dead find peace, I will pay you handsomely.
