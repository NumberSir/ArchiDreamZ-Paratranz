What do you want? Don't bother us all at once, #.
I'll get someone else to do the job. Leave.
If you try to do too much work, you will die. We can't accept this! We need you for new jobs later!
You want to take all the swag for yourself! I won't let this happen!
Complete your work before asking for more!
You work even harder than the slaves... I have to whip them more!
Finish your work before the boss comes and forces you to do it!
Do you think I'm stupid? I know you already have a job.
Come on, get back to work.
Get back to work, #.
Work yourself to death if you want, but don't do it in my lifetime!
