Don't rush like a woman. Do others tasks of our folk, and after that I will give you a task.
Of course I appreciate you, but can you do your others tasks before mine?
You take a many tasks. Do it.
I like that you want to help us, but over your other tasks.
I want to give my youth back and help all my friends. But I'm too old for this shit.
I see you are bisy, so i won't give you a new task.
You are too bisy for my questions.
You need help others.
You are too bisy, #
