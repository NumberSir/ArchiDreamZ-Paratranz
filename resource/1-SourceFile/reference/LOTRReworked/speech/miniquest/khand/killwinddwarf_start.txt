Many years ago, the dwarves of the Ironfists clan left the Red Mountains and settled near us in the Wind Mountains. Our Lord has ordered us to attack nim, and we have been fighting these lousy dwarves for hundreds of years. If you want to prove your loyalty to our people, kill $, our worst enemies, and you will be rewarded.
