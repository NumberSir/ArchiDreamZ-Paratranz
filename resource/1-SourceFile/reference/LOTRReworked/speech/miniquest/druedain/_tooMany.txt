It would be wrong to burden you with new assignments, while you still have unfinished business.
I see that you are ready to help, #. But you already have enough to do
Leave and talk to me later after you have helped others in need
Do you have time for my assignment, #?
Didn't you already promise to help other members of my people, #?
You are too busy to take on another assignment.
You are strong, #, but I have to refuse your help. You have unfinished business
Friends appreciate your help, but you've had enough
You have already made promises to my other people, #
Shouldn't you help those who have already made promises, #
I cannot accept your help, #. You must first keep the rest of your promises
Your spirit is strong, #. But you've had enough
