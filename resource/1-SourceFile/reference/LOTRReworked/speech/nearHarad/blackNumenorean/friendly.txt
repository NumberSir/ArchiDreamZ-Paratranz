I see a real warrior!
I hope you are with us, #.
The Gondorians are angry. In the past, they betrayed our King, Ar-Farazon.
Ar-Farazon was a great King. Sauron set him on the right path.
I've heard stories about Numenor... It's a pity that he sank into the depths of the ocean.
Traitors in Gondor will be put to death.
If I see a Gondorian, I will send him to his loved ones, Valar!
You're a good person. #, you made the right choice.
The Haradrim have a difficult character, but they are strong and powerful warriors.
The Umbarians are our brothers.
Have you heard anything about our brothers in the North?
How are things in Angmar interesting? Have you heard about them,#?
Trackers and the Gondorians deserve to die.
We are the true Dunedain. The pathetic stubs of the Faithful can't call themselves that.
Gondor was just lucky to defeat the Lord. But time is changing, the Lord has returned.
Death, death to the enemies of Numenor, the enemies of Umbar!
I've been to many places in the south. I would like to go north, to join the army of the Witch-King.
