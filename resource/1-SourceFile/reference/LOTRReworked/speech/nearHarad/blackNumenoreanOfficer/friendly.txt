I think you're ready to command the troops of Umbar.
I see you are a great warrior. The Numenoreans will follow you.
Crush the enemies! My guys will help you with this.
Death to the enemies of Umbar!
Stories about the greatness of Numenor are passed down from father to son.
Sauron has guided us on the right path.
Only the legends of the shining army of Ar-Farazon remained.
The last king of Numenor was the greatest. It's a pity he died.
Lead my warriors into battle, #!
Death to the enemies of the Numenoreans.
The Gondorians are lying, even though you already know that.
Even though you came from the North, but I trust you as my guys. After all, you have served Umbar well.
Someday the Gondorians will realize that they have been deceived.
Death to the liars and traitors of the King!
