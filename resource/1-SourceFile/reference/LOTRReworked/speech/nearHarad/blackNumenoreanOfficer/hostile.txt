I'll break your face!
Die, spy of Gondor!
Who are you? Get out of here!
I'll crush your skull!
Run, run while you can!
You are the enemy of Umbar. Such die first!
You'll die faster than you blink an eye, #!
I'll break your legs, and you won't run anywhere else!
Your pathetic ancestors won't hear you calling for help!
Death to you and your families!
I'll tear you up like a rabbit!
I'll roast you in the Flame of Udun!
What the...? Gondorians?!
Only Umbar's friends can approach us, #!
Die, #!
Die!
I would rather hear your cries of pain!
Soon you will scream, spy of the infidels!
For Numenor! Die!
It's a pity that you became a hostage to the lies of Gondor. You'll die for your stupidity.
Run! As long as I'm merciful.
Our armor is strong, our spirit is strong. And is your faith in the lies of traitors strong?
