I won't sell you anything, #.
Sorry, #. I don't trade with bullies.
You are not welcome in this market, #!
If you even touch me or my goods with your finger, I will call the guards.
You're the stupidest person I know, #.
I don't trade with murderers.
There is no need for your presence, #. Get out of here.
I am an honest merchant, #, but you are a dishonest person.
I confess, I consider myself an honest trader. Unfortunately, #, honest traders don't trade with people like you.
Did you really think that we would greet you with flowers and songs, #? Go away!
Get off our lands!
I don't want to tarnish my reputation, #. I only trade with honest people.
I only trade with good people, with Umbarians.
I do not trade with traitors of the human race!
I'm not buying anything from you!
What are you doing here? Get out of Umbar, leave our lands!
I wouldn't trade with you even if the guards weren't watching us.
I'd rather die than give you my goods.
