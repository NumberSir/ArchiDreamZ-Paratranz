I'm sorry, but I don't know you at all and I won't trade with you.
Welcome to our lands.
Do you want to buy equipment? I'm sorry, but I don't trade with everyone I meet.
I welcome you to our lands, #.
Make your name famous in our area, and only after that I will be able to sell you equipment.
I don't trust you enough to trade with you.
I can't be sure that you're not a Gondorian.
I trade only with those whom my people respect.
Prove that you can be trusted, and then I will agree to trade with you.
You're bothering me, #.
Are you a friend of Umbar, or his enemy?
Are you a friend of True Dunedain, #?
I trade only with true friends, #.
I don't trade with everyone I meet...
you have to prove your loyalty to the true dunedain if you want to trade with me.
I don't trust you enough to give you my goods, even for money. I only trade with our allies.
Prove yourself as a great warrior, as a defender of our great people, and then we will bargain.
How can I be sure that you are not from Gondor? Here you will buy a sword from me now, and then you will cut out the whole village.
