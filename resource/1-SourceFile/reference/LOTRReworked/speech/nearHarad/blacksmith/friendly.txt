Do you need equipment? Just bring me some coins.
Welcome, #! What can I do for you?
I barely have enough materials to fulfill orders.
Are you a friend of Umbar, #?
Do you want a handmade blade, #?
Do you need armor? Our world is dangerous, we cannot do without them.
I'm still looking for a student...
I'm forging the best weapons in Umbar!
We have preserved the knowledge of our ancestors about the hardening and forging of steel, #. We create excellent blades and excellent armor.
In Numenor, they made beautiful helmets and the strongest armor! I have achieved even more.
Good afternoon, #! Have you come for equipment?
Welcome to Umbar, #! What can I offer you?
These are difficult times... materials are now rare and expensive.
What do you need, #?
What brought you to our wasteland, #?
Be on your guard, #. These parts are full of enemies.
Not everyone weakens under the yoke of years - the earth keeps its roots.
The skill of the Numenoreans is lost, but I have learned to make helmets that are not inferior to them in quality.
