Get out of here, you filthy animal!
As soon as you climb on them, they will throw you off and trample you into the mud!
Umbarian horses will not serve you, #!
Away, villain!
This land will not go to the Gondorians!
I hope your steed will throw you off its back and trample you.
Don't touch my horses, you scoundrel!
No Umbar horse will agree to serve a villain, #!
You are not a friend to our horses!
You are my enemy! Just like my horses!
Get away, #!
I won't trade with such a scoundrel.
Get out, killer!
These horses don't trust you, and neither do I!
No Umbarian horse will stoop to serve you.
You have disgraced this stable by your mere presence!
You are not a friend of Numenor.
These horses are only for Umbar's friends
Run! Run and don't come back!
I don't want you in my stable.
Leave my stable!
