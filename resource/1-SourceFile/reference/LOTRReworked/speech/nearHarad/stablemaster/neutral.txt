We Numenoreans guard the horses carefully.
Maybe you know how to ride a horse, #, but how well do horses know you?
I'm afraid you'll have to go to the other stables.
We value our horses. And we don't give them to strangers.
Good afternoon, #! Are you a friend of Umbar or just a passerby?
I wouldn't say I've seen you before.
You're not from these parts, right?
