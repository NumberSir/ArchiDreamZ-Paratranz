I traveled a lot to the steppes to reach you.
We merchants travel everywhere from Rhun to Harad
The Rhun steppes are large, and only we know the right path.
I can hear your coins jingle, #.
For you, #, I give a good price!
I have a deal you can't refuse, #!
All these travels are thirsty!
Do you have food to sell, #? We will need food on our long roads through the sands.
I have brought great treasures from the Goldenstone Rhunost
I bring goods and news from the East, #.
You are like a person who learns a lot when he sees. I respect that.
May I interest you with some of my products?
It doesn't look like you're from this place.
I am always open to another deal. What are you looking for there?
Competition doesn't always lead to better deals, #.
Bandits - these dishonest thieves, they are disgusting to me!
Karanoda ... my home. There I began to trade for the first time ... A. Visit it, #. This is not Rhunost, but also a cozy place.
I respect the Haradrim. They are excellent warriors and honest traders.
I ought to go to Khand. I have never been there. But I heard that cruel, but honest and courageous people live there.
I love meeting new people.
I hate to admit it, but war is good for trade.
I want to travel to Harad one more time before I retire.
Gnomes often offer a good price for the product, but several times they wanted to snatch jamon from the counter. With them you need an eye and an eye.
