Faster, #! If a sandstorm starts, I will not have time to reach Rhun
Other lands, other treasures, other deals await me!
We'll be on our way soon. This is your last chance!
We will not wait forever, my friends.
Forward! Go ahead, we must go!
Go quickly, #, for the roads of the desert are calling me!
The road to the East is long and we can no longer hesitate!
Last chance! If we don't close the deal now, you might regret it forever!
