Damn you and leave, #, you are not Rhudel's friend!
Even I don't sell dirt like you!
I will not accept the tainted coins of Gondor and his allies!
Get out!
I'm afraid you will try to rob me! Get out, #!
The deal is canceled, but you will pay!
The price of your crime is your life!
This is why we are hiring security! Help!
You were hired by those people from Bakrizad, right?
What, the Corsairs were unhappy with their craft?
