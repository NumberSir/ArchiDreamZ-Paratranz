What do you do in these lands, traveler?
If you need my mighty blades, you must first prove yourself!
I don't deal with strangers!
Come back when you have a name in these lands.
You want those shiny axes, huh? Well, you have to do a few things to get them!
I forge the most powerful tools, weapons, and armor! But not for you ... at least not yet.
My beard! Does a stranger think that he can just buy something from me!
A dwarf doesn't just trade with a stranger.
Who are you?
If you want to trade with me, you must show yourself to the people of these lands.
I forge only the most powerful for the most powerful.
I don't trade with strangers like you.
If you want to trade with me, you must show yourself to our clan.
I don't forge the strongest and best weapons for some stranger to try to buy.
You are not worthy of my mighty blades and axes.
You are not fit enough to possess dwarven items.
You can only trade with me when you prove your loyalty to our king.
