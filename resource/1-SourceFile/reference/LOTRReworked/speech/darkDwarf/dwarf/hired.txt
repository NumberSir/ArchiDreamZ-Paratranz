Ah! How I miss our stately halls! But a dwarf doesn't run from battle! I'll be back when we're done.
Death to the enemies of Sauron! No mercy for traitors from the North!
Lead us into battle,#!
I am proud to fight for your cause,#! let's
Kill the Dark Lord's enemies!
The beard itches, it means to be strong.
Our enemies will be crushed with hammers, and those who survive, we will finish off with axes!
The axes of the dwarves are sharpened and ready to cut,#!
Few in middle-earth can resist our might!
That's all well and good, but where did all the ale go?
I would sell my soul to drink a nice Cup of ale!
Nargun-Khazad!
We dwarves are fighting for a common cause, and there Is not a man, dwarf, or elf who has survived the blow of my axe!
I bet my beard that we will win!
It's really a great honor for me to fight for such a brave warrior like you,#!
