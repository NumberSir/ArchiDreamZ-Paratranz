Get out! There are no vegetables for you!
Ring the bell! The enemies are here!
You won't even get a hundredth of my harvest!
If you were a turnip, I would have thrown you out, rotten!
You have the Enemy's mark on you!
I'll break your head with a hoe, just come!
If I became a farmer, this does not mean that I have forgotten how to hold a sword in my hands!
And with you I will fertilize the soil, my good future corpse ...
You made a big mistake!
You didn't come here to feed the horses, #, did you?
If you were a crop, the farmers would starve to death from such rot.
Get off my farm, bag of dung!
