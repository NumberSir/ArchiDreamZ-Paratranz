Good day, #!
Hello, #! Want to buy seeds?
Have you come to buy groceries, #?
Do not step on my beds, please.
I hope that you did not steal from my garden.
Listen, do you have any hoes? Ours are already falling apart. Pay for every new hoe.
I still have a couple of boxes of vegetables and wheat in stock. I can sell.
I offer you the best vegetables in the valley.
I always need new agricultural tools and always buy them at a good price.
My workers are the most hardworking in our village! Bring me a few dozen silver coins and you can hire a couple of them.
If you are looking for steel swords or armor, then you are in the wrong place!
Did you know # that all farmers wear these hats?
Turnips, carrots, lettuce, wheat - I have it all! Well, maybe not everything, but almost everything.
My vegetables are not free, they take time and diligence. No need to spit them out of the garden.
Don't forget to feed the horses!
Horses, #. Oh, our horses love vegetables, for them we grow all this.
