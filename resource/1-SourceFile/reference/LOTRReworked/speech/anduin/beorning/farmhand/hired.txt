Good day, #.
Vegetables grow well.
Hey, #.
The soil is fertile here.
Ah, if I had an ox, work would go three times faster ...
There are still so many things to do ...
I am working hard, as you can see.
It's good that you are talking to us. Usually, no one communicates with the workers.
I don't have much to say about my work.
Remember to keep the ground moist.
How are you doing, #?
Isn't it time to rest?
Our crops will be ready soon!
I hope you will share part of the harvest with the horses.
Our horses love fresh vegetables!
Another day was spent at the farm ...
They don't sing songs about summer residents.
People in the banquet halls will not say a word about us ...
It looks like it's going to rain.
Watch out for the orcs in the valley!
