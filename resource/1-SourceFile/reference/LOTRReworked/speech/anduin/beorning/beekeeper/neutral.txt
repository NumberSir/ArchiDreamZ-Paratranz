I won't sell anything to a stranger!
First, earn my trust, then we'll talk!
Where did you come?
Come back at least as our friend, foreigner!
I do not know who you are, what kind of trade can we talk about?
I won't even sell you a drop of honey!
My bees worked for the representatives of my people, not the strangers!
What was your name there? #? I haven't heard your name anywhere!
First, prove that I can trust you, #!
