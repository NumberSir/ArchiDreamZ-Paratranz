I hope you won't touch our people, #.
Welcome to Anduin Valley, #!
The most beautiful sunset can be seen only at the top of Karrok!
We used to trade with many of the peoples of Middle-earth, but after the return of Sauron, we have little confidence in anyone.
Thanks to Beorn and his descendants, we feel safe.
Do you want to know the recipe for honey cakes, #? Haha, I won't tell you about it even for a bag of gold!
Not a single orc or warg will touch my own family!
What did you want, #?
The most delicious honey is prepared by the Beornings!
I wonder how the Woodmen are doing now ...
Anduin is a really beautiful place!
Our villages are well protected from outsiders.
Be careful on the road, #!
