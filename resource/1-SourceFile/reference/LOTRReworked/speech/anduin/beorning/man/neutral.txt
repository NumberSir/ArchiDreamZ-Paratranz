Stay out of my sight, outsider.
I do not know where you are from, but I advise you to return to yourself.
Who are you and what do you need?
First, earn our trust, foreigner!
You don't look like an orc, but I still don't trust you.
If Sauron sent you here, get out!
I don't think you can be trusted.
For what purpose did you come to our lands?
Don't even try to fool us!
I know that you are not from these lands.
