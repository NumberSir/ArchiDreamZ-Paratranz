Who are you to ask me for soldiers?
We'll talk another time, stranger!
I will never give the opportunity to compand my people to a random traveler!
In addition to money, you must have honor with you before the Men of Anduin.
This is the first time I've heard of you, #. You won't get any of my soldiers.
Come back when you become a friend of our people.
Give you my troops? Haha, not this time!
First, prove yourself worthy to lead the Beornings squad.
When you bring me a bag of orc heads, then we'll talk.
My people won't follow a stranger.
