Get out, stranger!
Even my horses vkurse, what a scoundrel you are!
Don't go near my stable!
I won't sell you anything!
Get out, #!
How dare you come here?
The Chief will find you and tear you to pieces!
Get away from my horses, creature!
None of my horses will be your steed, #!
Get out, slave of Darkness!
The enemies of my people have no place here!
Run while you can, #!
I will not trade with you, no way!
