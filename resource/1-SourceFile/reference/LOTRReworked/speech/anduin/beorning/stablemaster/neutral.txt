I won't sell anything to a stranger.
Even if you are an excellent rider, you have not earned my trust.
You better get out of my stable.
My horses won't belong to a stranger.
First, I need to know if you are a friend to my people or an enemy.
This is your first time here, right?
Go back where you came from.
I don't trust you with my horses.
No, I won't sell you anything!
