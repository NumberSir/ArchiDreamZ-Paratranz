The integrity of Anduin is in our hands!
Nobody will touch our families!
Do you know what I did when I first met the orc? I cut off his head!
One day the war will end and we will live a quiet life.
Wargs are scary only as long as they are still alive.
I hope you can help us, #.
We will definitely survive!
You can't let Beorn down!
Welcome to Anduin Valley, #.
You must always be ready for defense.
I am always ready to protect my people!
