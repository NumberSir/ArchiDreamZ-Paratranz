Don't let us down, captain!
What I should do, #?
I can't wait to fight next to you!
I've been training for several years, so I definitely won't let you down!
Nobody can stop us.
Shall we go to Dol Guldur?
I will do as you order.
Enemies will fear us!
My weapon will save your life, #!
Forward to Anduin!
I'm always ready for battle, #.
Hope I will meet my family again.
