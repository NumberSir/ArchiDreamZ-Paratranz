You better run!
You're in deep trouble, #!
You will die at my hands!
Did you want to leave with impunity?
You will die here and now!
Die, you bastard!
I knew you couldn't be trusted!
Back off, you bastard!
An end to your crimes, #!
You knew what you were doing!
For Beorn!
The chief ordered to catch you, freak!
Get up brothers, the enemies are here!
Here you are, Sauron's toy!
This fight will be your last!
