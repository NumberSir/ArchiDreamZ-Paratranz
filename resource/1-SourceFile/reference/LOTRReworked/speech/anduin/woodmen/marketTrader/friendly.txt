Welcome to my humble abode, #
My wares are not as highly valued by my people as those of the hunters.
I have a lot of interesting things, cucumbers, tomatoes, tree bark, and other interesting plants
Don't look at my reputation, #, my products are good enough
Many do not understand how delicious mushroom stew can be.
Do you want to buy my products? I will sell them to you with joy
Tomatoes and cucumbers can be used to make a delicious salad
Strange things, my wares are more valuable among the Beornig than among my people.
Beornings loves vegetables and fruits, and they often buy them from me. And you can buy them, #
I want to drink kvass
I do not like the fact that more and more orcs are found on our border
