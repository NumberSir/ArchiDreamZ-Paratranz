Although my wares are not highly valued, I will not sell them to every vagrant I meet!
Are you a friend of our people?
You don't look like a forester or a beorning
Who are you?
Do you want to taste my vegetables? Earn a reputation with my people first
I may be a kind person, but I will not sell my goods to you until you become a friend of my people.
You are some kind of suspicious
Are you a spy by any chance?
Come to me when every branch in our grove will know who you are
