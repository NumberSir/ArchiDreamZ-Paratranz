Let's cleanse the forest from filth!
I'm listening, #
Show us the way
I want ale and sleep.
No Orc would dare to stand in our way!
I want to drink something strong and intoxicating, but I can't
I'm all in attention
I will follow any order!
I'll tell you a recipe for a good fight. My blade plus a small and ugly goblin = head off your shoulders!
As you order
Good pies are delicious. Lots of meat, little dough
Get ready, foresters!
Honestly, I'm not afraid of the orcs, or trolls, or even the mystical ghostly servants of Sauron. But the dashing spiders are my worst nightmare
I will fight for you to the last drop of blood!
You are a good person and an excellent commander! It is an honor for me to fight side by side with you!
