I'll deal with you quickly!
Get out of these lands, orc bunch!
You will die by my sword!
You must be punished for your crimes!
I won't let you go any further ... these lands are not for you
Die, bandit!
You have no chance against our spears and blades!
You will not pass, creature of darkness!
Now the end of your atrocities has come, #!
You will fall before us!
In the name of the forest!
Cook onions!
Enemies! Get ready for battle, comrades-in-arms!
Die, enemy of the woodsmen!
You will not survive this battle!
