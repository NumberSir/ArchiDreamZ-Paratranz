I have protected, will protect, and I will protect these reserved lands!
While I am on duty, not a single Guldur creature will make its way here!
It may seem that the foresters are a weak people, but we will finish off every scum that tries to come here!
Although the Necromancer was driven out of Dol Guldur many years ago, shadows are gathering over the cursed fortress again
I will not allow any Orc or bandit to enter these lands!
The captain of my squad has told me more than once that war will break out soon. His words come true
Shadows gathering over Dol Guldur
Beornings warriors are as tough and strong as ours!
Welcome to Forest Shelter, #!
Who knows when the spawn of darkness from Dol-guldur will descend here. We must remain vigilant, #
I have heard disturbing rumors of attacks on our southern borders.
Rumor has it that even Thranduil and his military elf forestry are preparing for war.
Take care of yourself, #. The foliage of Mirkwood is extremely dense, and it contains many condemnations of darkness.
