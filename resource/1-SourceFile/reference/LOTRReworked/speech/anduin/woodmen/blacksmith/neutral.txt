You are not like one of us
Money is not the main thing, you have no reputation with our people
Who are you?
Come back when you get stronger
My armor is too good for a weakling like you, so I won't sell it to you.
You will become famous among our people, so be it, I will sell you my blacksmith work
I donâ€™t sell blades to first comers.
Only friends of my people are allowed to use the swords of my work, #.
