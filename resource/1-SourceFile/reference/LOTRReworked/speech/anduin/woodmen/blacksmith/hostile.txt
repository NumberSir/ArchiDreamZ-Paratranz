Thief! The villain! Rogue!
You are the enemy of the foresters!
Get out, #!
Go away, villain!
I will drive your head into the ground!
Leave, otherwise you will never leave here again!
You're not welcome here, #!
You are a freak!
I wonâ€™t get anything for you, for the life of me!
You made the mistake of coming here, #!
Do you think the hammer is in my hands for beauty? I'll flatten your head off now!
Well, I'll stuff your face!
Do you think that I only know how to forge swords? Come here, let me take off your rotten head!
