Are you new here? I won't sell my wares to the first vagrant
Do you want to buy a tasty meat from me? Build a reputation among our people for a start
Something I don't believe you
My people won't bargain with strangers
Although we are good to the wanderers, but do not be impudent, I will not sell my goods to someone who has not yet made a reputation among us!
You're too suspicious. You are not the thorn of the necromancer by any chance, huh !?
I will not sell such valuable fox fur to such a muddy type like you.
Ha ha! Did you really think that I would sell you my goods? Earn a reputation and only then come back to me!
I'd rather sell a product to a gnome than to you!
Even the elves of the enchanted kingdom appreciate my goods, and after that you think that I will sell my goods to someone like you?
