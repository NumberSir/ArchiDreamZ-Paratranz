My boys walk the battlefield like a hurricane
My boys are the toughest and most courageous soldiers in all these forests.
I can't give you my guys for free, so pay and you get powerful warriors
My guys have mated with the Beornings for a long time, and they, as you know, respect only strength and dexterity.
Even the elven lords of the enchanted kingdom appreciated my boys.
My boys' archery skills can only be matched by the elves from the enchanted kingdom!
I can give you a detachment, # if, of course, you pay for the equipment of these people.
No one dares to stand in the way of my warriors!
Do you want to hire my people, #?
