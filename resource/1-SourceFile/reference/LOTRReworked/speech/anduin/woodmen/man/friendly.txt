There is no rest in our forests
Welcome to Forest Shelter
What's natural is not ugly
Are you going to eat the tomato or will I eat it?

Have you ever tried Beornings honey cakes? Extremely delicious pastries!
Recently, our heads of communities have been talking with the leaders of the Beornings, apparently preparing for war.
Be careful, Mirkwood is an extremely dangerous place
In the Forest Shelter, every wandering warrior can find food and shelter.
Have you ever been to Dale? Dalians are a kindred people to us
Our lands are fertile
