Do you want to hire the best of the best? Then don't act like an asshole!
You will make a great slave, #. But not a commander!
You made the wrong tower, pie-buddy!
Only a real bastard can command my uruks, #.
My warriors would rather devour you than allow you to command!
Prove your loyalty to the Necromancer and then go down the drain
Go to the other tower, slug! You have nothing to do in this one!
Even the weakest orc won't follow you!
You are not even worthy to be here, worm!
Where did you get the idea that you are worthy to command the best warriors of the Necromancer? Get out of here, snaga!
Even a troll leader is better than you, dumbass!
Are you completely repulsed, #? Get out of here, otherwise you will go to my soldiers for lunch!
You are as weak as these wood-lovers! Or maybe you are their spy?
