Nothing has the right to even talk to me!

Service to the Necromancer began long before the castellan rebirth took place.
The darkness will consume everything.
The dream was too long.
Sleep may have dulled the perception of reality, but not the blade
Fear of enemies fuels the cursed blade
Castellan's blade guides the necromancer's bony hand
Phantom Armor Tempered with Sorcerous Flame
The less you know the better you sleep
Being a castellan is our greatest honor
