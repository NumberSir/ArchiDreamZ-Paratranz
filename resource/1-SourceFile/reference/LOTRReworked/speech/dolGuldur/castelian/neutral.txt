A nonentity like you has no right to even talk to me!
Don't anger ghosts, #
During my lifetime, I served the Necromancer.
The darkness will consume everything.
I slept too long, it's time to wake up to show the world the greatness of my Lord again!
My sleep may have dulled my perception, but my blade is still capable of cutting through anyone!
My armor is tempered by sorcery, and my sword is fueled by the fear of my enemies.
