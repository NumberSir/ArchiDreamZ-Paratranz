My goods are Guldur herbs and other magical junk.
I see that you are a devoted servant of the Necromancer
Now that you've become one of us, it's not a shame to sell you a couple of things
My tinctures will be useful to you in battles
My goods are highly regarded even among the Guldur Uruks, who are very violent.
Fight for the Necromancer, and maybe I'll give a couple of my goods for free
Let's drink to our victory!
