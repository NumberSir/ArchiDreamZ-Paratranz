My products are not meant for people I don't know
Who are you to buy my goods? Are you a devoted warrior of the Necromancer?
My potions are not made for those whose name I do not know
You look like a servant of the cursed elven kingdom
Come when you get the respect among my people
Are you a servant of the Necromancer?
Come back when even the proud Guldur Uruks recognize you
You are nobody without a reputation among us
Money can't buy my devotion
