Who are you? Servant of the Necromancer?
You are not like one of us, who are you?
Perhaps you serve the enemies of our master? Get out!
Prove that you are loyal to the Necromancer
I'll feed you to the spiders if you don't get away!
Nothing like you dare not even approach my warriors!
I am not attracted to money, especially from people like you!
You need not only money, but also the respect of the orcs!
Devotion cannot be bought!
Do you want to command my guys? Ha! Don't make me laugh, maggot!
