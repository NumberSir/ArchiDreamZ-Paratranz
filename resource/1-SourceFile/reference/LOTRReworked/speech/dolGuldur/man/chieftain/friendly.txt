You have proven that you are a loyal servant of the Necromancer
Servants of the Necromancer understand each other, because they serve the same master
Only a common cause makes my warriors serve you
And what do you suggest I do with these coins?
We will destroy all enemies of the Necromancer!
My crossbowmen are the best
Thanatos will gladden a warrior like you
Smear the enemies of our master!
The army of the broken will help you in battles, #
Tremble, enemies of the Necromancer!
