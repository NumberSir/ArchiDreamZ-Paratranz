The main mistake of my enemies is that they angered my master, and therefore me!
My service to the Necromancer has reborn me
Forward to the Necromancer!
Sleep dulled my senses, but not the blade
I do not sleep while I am busy hunting the enemies of the dark lord
My sword may look rusty, but I spilled so much blood on it.
My sword only guides the hand of the Necromancer
I will destroy every enemy of the Dark Lord
Even if I die, my ghost will kill my enemies for me!
You are also a servant of the Dark Lord, that's why I help you
