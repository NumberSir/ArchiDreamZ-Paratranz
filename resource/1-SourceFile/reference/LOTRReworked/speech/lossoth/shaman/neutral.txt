Prove that you can be trusted, and then maybe I will start trading with you
I'm not sure if you are a friend of the Lossoth people
Are you a Lossoth friend, #? I doubt it
I only trade with friends of our people, #. Who knows, maybe you are the enemy spy?
I will not share the secrets of my people with the first person I meet
You must prove your loyalty to our people if you want to buy anything from me
Do you want to get the magic karkhuron? Prove that you deserve it!
I will not trade with a stranger, #
Prove your loyalty to us, #, and maybe then I'll trade with you
I am the guide to the spirit world and the voice of Karkhu himself. Who else are you?
I will not share the secrets of my people with just anyone
You need to make a name for yourself in these lands if you want to trade with me
What makes you think you deserve to trade with me, #?
You don't look like a Lossoth friend, #
Prove your loyalty to our people and then you can purchase my products
