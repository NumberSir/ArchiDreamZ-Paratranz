The dark spawn will fall from our spears!
We, Lossoth, learn how to use weapons from early childhood. Otherwise, we will not survive in these lands.
I will follow you through fire and ice!
Let's hunt!
We will protect Forochel!
Forward!
For Forochel!
Our enemies will fall!
I'm glad to follow someone like you, #
We will follow you even to the Iron Lands!
Karkhu bless us!
We do not know fear!
I am honored to fight side by side with you!
I wonder if I'll ever see my tribe
Even the greatest cold will not stop us on the way to victory!
Vile orcs fear our troops!
We will destroy the witchcraft land!
Lead us to victory!
To battle!
Let's show our enemies the power of Lossoth!
No mercy for the servants of darkness!
Let's avenge our friends!
Enemies cannot stand against us!
We are born warriors and hunters.
