I won't give you anything, thief!
Get out, #! I will not trade with the enemy of my people!
You're not welcome here!
You are on time, #. I just sharpened my dagger!
If you even touch my goods with your finger, I will cut them off for you!
You are the stupidest person I know if you came here with evil intentions!
Run away from here before you become food for bears!
Your dirty hands will never touch our equipment!
Lossoth don't trade with people like you!
Did you really think that we would welcome you here? Go away!
Get out of here!
You will never know the secrets of our craft!
I don't trade with villains like you
I do not trade with thieves and murderers, much less with servants of evil!
I won't buy anything from you, bastard!
What have you forgotten, poor servant of Angmar? Get out of Forochel!
I will not trade with you even on pain of death
I'd rather die than give you the Lossoth treasure!
I am an honest merchant and you are a dishonorable villain.
Evil has no place in these lands! Get out of here!
I will not trade with the enemies of my people!
Forodwaith's beasts will tear you apart if you don't leave here!
I will not trade with minions of Darkness!
Disgusting servant of evil! You will get nothing from me but death!
Leave here, otherwise you will stay here forever!
Lossoth Craft will not be yours!
