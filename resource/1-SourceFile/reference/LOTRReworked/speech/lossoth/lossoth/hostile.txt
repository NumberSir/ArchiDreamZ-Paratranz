The cold will forge your pathetic soul, #!
Run, coward!
You will never set foot on these lands again!
Your master will not help you, #
So that you freeze to death, freak!
Your name will be blown away by the icy wind!
We show more respect even to wild animals than to you!
You don't belong in Ice Bay!
Return to the darkness, wretched servant of the Iron King!
Aaaargh!
For the snow!
Run, servant of darkness!
I will feed your pitiful remains to walruses!
Are you challenging the Lossoth people?
For Karhu!
Run, or your wretched body will be swallowed by the ice!
I have no pity for you, scoundrel!
You are no match for me, scum!
I am not afraid of you and your master!
Even a dead walrus is a more worthy opponent than you!
Leave, otherwise you will become food for bears!
I'll finish you off!
Why did you come here, brat of Angmar?
You shouldn't have come here!
People like you are not welcome here at all!
Who are you? Spy of the Witch-king?
Get out of here, otherwise you will know the anger of the Snow Folk!
The blizzard will drown out your death cries, #!
For Forochel!
Whose ill will prompted you to come here, fool?
This is your last breath!
