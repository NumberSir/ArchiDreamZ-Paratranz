I won't give you anything, thief!
Forochel's treasures will never be yours!
Get out, #! I will not trade with the enemy of my people!
You're not welcome here!
If you even touch my goods with your finger, I'll cut it off for you!
You are the stupidest person I know if you came here with evil intentions!
Run away from here before you become food for bears!
Lossoth don't trade with people like you!
Did you really think that we would welcome you here? Go away!
Get out of here!
I will gut you like a fish!
I don't trade with villains like you
I do not trade with thieves and murderers, much less with servants of evil!
I won't buy anything from you, bastard!
What have you forgotten, poor servant of Angmar? Get out of Forochel!
I will not trade with you even on pain of death
I'd rather die than give you the Lossoth treasure!
I am an honest merchant and you are a dishonorable villain.
Evil has no place in these lands! Get out of here!
I will not trade with the enemies of my people!
Get out of here, otherwise you'll go to feed the fish!
Forodwaith's beasts will tear you apart if you don't leave here!
I will not trade with minions of Darkness!
Disgusting servant of evil! You will get nothing from me but death!
Leave here, otherwise you will stay here forever!
Run until you become bait for the fish!
Get out, orc brat! One more step and I'll throw you into the hole!
