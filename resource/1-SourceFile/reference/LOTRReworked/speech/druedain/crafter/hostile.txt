How dare you come here, bastard?
I'd rather die than do business with you!
You're not welcome here, #!
Run before you are torn apart!
I will make a beautiful bowl from your skull!
How stupid you did when you came here, #!
Our warriors will crush you, gorgun!
How did you have the nerve to come here?
Return to your master, slave of darkness!
I will deal with you with my own hands, monster!
Enough for you to walk through our forests, #!
Now you will not be healthy!
How are you on time, #! I just sharpened my blade!
Only a fool decides to threaten me
I would never trade with someone like you!
