How dare you come here, bastard?
I'd rather die than do business with you!
You're not welcome here, #!
Run before you are torn apart!
I will make a beautiful bowl from your skull!
How stupid you did when you came here, #!
Our warriors will crush you, gorgun!
How did you have the nerve to come here?
Return to your master, slave of darkness!
I will deal with you with my own hands, monster!
Enough for you to walk through our forests, #!
How dare you challenge me, the great leader?
My warriors will deal with you at once, spawn of darkness!
Here is the gorgun, my brothers! Kill him!
