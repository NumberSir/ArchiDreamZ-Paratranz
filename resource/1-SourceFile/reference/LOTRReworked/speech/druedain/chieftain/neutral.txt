You need to gain the trust of our people if you want to lead them.
Your time has not come yet, # Come when you are ready to lead our people
Forest people will not follow just anyone, #
Only friends of the Forest are allowed to command my warriors!
You have nothing to do here, #
What fly has bitten you since you decided you could hire my people?
What's your name? #? The first time I've heard
Come when you show yourself, #
Great warriors won't go after a weakling like you!
Prove that you are truly our friend, then come back
Are you strong enough to lead my companions into battle?
We are a proud people, and we will not go into battle for just anyone
I do not trust you. Defeat a couple of dozen gorgons and then return
Glorious warriors of the Forest will follow only a worthy leader!
