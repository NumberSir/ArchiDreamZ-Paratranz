Peace to you, #
Welcome to our forest
I'm glad you're not one of our enemies
We are glad to see you friend
Drughu greet you
What brings you here?
I can tell you many stories if you wish
Our forests are beautiful, aren't they?
You are safe in our forest, #
Good spirits have been keeping our forest for a thousand years
We are not as simple as we seem, #
Welcome, traveler. What brings you to this forest?
You don't often meet travelers in our area
Be like a traveler at home, I will not refuse anything
We haven't met guests for a long time, #
We live in harmony with nature and do not kill animals for no reason. I advise you to do the same.
Have you ever seen the mighty Pukkols?
We hate gorgons, #. Hope you too
Many amazing plants and mushrooms grow in our forest.
Several thousand years have passed, but we still remember our friendship with the people of the Beautiful. I wonder if they remember us?
Be kind to nature and she will be kind to you
Be careful, #. Some plants in our forest are poisonous
We don't favor Big People too much. They are proud and do not like nature at all. However, they hate gorguns, just as we do.
The wind is changing. Can you feel it, #?
Our people are much more powerful than the people of the Stone City think.
Even a stone in our forest can have extraordinary properties.
We do not build huge settlements of stone, but we know how to work with it much better than other peoples
