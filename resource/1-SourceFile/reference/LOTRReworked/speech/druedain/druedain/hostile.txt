Get out of here, monster!
This place will be your grave!
Run, otherwise you won't collect bones
Go away, you evil brat!
Traaaah!
Your bones will be great material!
You have no place in our forest, #
Die, gorgun!
How dare you enter our forest?
Gorgun! Gorgun!
Vanayayayayayayay!
Return to your master, nothing!
You cannot hide from the wrath of the Forest!
Die, servant of the monsters!
Aaaah!
Now your stupid head will separate from your pathetic torso!
Death to the enemy!
Now you will feel the power of our weapon!
Uiiii!
How dare you enter our native forest, scoundrel?
Anxiety! Enemies in the forest!
This is your last breath, freak!
I will crush you like a cockroach!
You're not welcome here, #
Oooooo!
