Drive the darkness from our lands!
Let's protect our land!
The enemy will feel our power!
Death to the gorgun!
Let's turn enemies into nothing!
Glad to fight side by side with you, #
Lead us into battle, #!
For our forests!
Vile creatures fear the strength of a friend!
For yourself and for the forest!
Let's show these gorguns!
The enemy will not resist!
It's time to hunt monsters
May the spirits of the Forest help us!
I will make myself armor from the bones of our enemies!
The enemy will die before our army notices!
It's time to speak to the enemy with the language of brute force!
Together with you we are invincible!
Forward, #!
