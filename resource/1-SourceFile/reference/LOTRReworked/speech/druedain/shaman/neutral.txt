Do you want to talk to me? Prove that you deserve it!
I'm not sure if you are a friend of our people
I do not reveal forest secrets to anyone I meet
I only trade with friends of our people, #.
Sorry, but I don't trade with strangers
Prove your loyalty to us, #, and maybe then I'll trade with you
You are not ready to trade with me yet, #
I will not share the secrets of my people with just anyone
You need to make a name for yourself in these lands if you want to trade with me
Where did you get the idea that you deserve to trade with me, #?
You don't look like a friend of the draghu, #
The Secrets of the Forest must not fall into the wrong hands.
The forest spirits warned me against trading with you.
I feel that you are not ready to take a look at my products yet
I don’t know you and I’m not going to trade with you
Only faithful friends of the Forest can trade with me
