Leave this stable. While I ask for good.
I'll call security right now.
I may be a groom, but I can hold a sword in my hands.
None of the horses will go to the Enemy.
No passages for the servants of the Enemy!
Gundabad Spawn!
You shouldn't have come here.
Now you will get it with a stick.
Get out!
I have a familiar gnome. You better not mess with him.
You will know Erebor's wrath.
Dale will never fall.
You are about to die.
Go into the darkness.
If you think that I will bow to you, then you are wrong.
It seems to me that you can't come here.
Trade with you? Your hands are covered in blood!
