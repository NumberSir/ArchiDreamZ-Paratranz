Hey, #.
Best horse for Dale's friend!
Where are you from?
Dwarfs don't buy horses from us. Can you buy, #?
We rarely see Western travelers here ... You seem friendly, though.
Don't forget to feed your steed.
My horses are not Rohan, but they are not bad either.
I hope one of my horses will serve you well.
To fight the Enemy!
I saw Thranduil as a child. Since then, it has not changed, and my years are drawing to a close. Oh those elves ...
Have you been told about the dragon?
The best horses of the North. Just me!
You are a brave warrior, #. Lead my horse into battle.
My horse will save your life someday.
