I do not trust you.
I am watching you closely.
As I understand you are not from here? I don't trade with strangers. Earn Trust.
Who are you, #?
Why did you come?
Dalish have keen eyes, and loyal friends are gnomes. So don't even think about throwing something away.
Think by yourself. Would you trade with the person you see for the first time?
Kill a couple of orcs. And then I'll think, maybe I'll trust you with horses.
