You are not worthy of my goods.
I don’t sell anything to murderers.
You want to kill me, #?
I don’t know why you need it. What have the good people of Dale done to you?
Get away from my shop.
Don't come near.
Gundabad scum.
I will face death with my head up, but I will not sell you anything.
I don't think we are bargaining.
Get out. Get out!
