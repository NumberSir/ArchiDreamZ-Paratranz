Hey, #.
How are you?
Dale's Best Fair!
This cracker is for you. For Dale's friend.
I would give it for free, but you understand.
A souvenir for the traveler from the West.
Many people think that toys are for children. I think they are wrong.
Where are you from, #?
To Dale's friend the best product.
I was going to close, but I'll probably serve you.
Toys, crackers. Every whim for your money.
Do you need a ring?
