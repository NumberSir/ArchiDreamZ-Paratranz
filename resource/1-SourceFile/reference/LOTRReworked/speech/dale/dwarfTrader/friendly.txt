Hey, #.
How are you?
Build again ... Oh, how everything is started.
You know, stones are not very easy to carry.
Nice stone, from the mines of Erebor.
I work for the glory of King Dain!
We have rebuilt Erebor, and we will rebuild Dale.
Every enemy of Dale is an enemy of Erebor!
You are a great warrior, #. And every great warrior needs a strong home. My stone is perfect for this.
Elya ...
There is no better drink than dwarf ale.
Durin's beard! This is a stone!
The most beautiful gems from the depths of Erebor.
The best jewelers are dwarfs.
In the mining trade, there is no one equal to the dwarfs.
