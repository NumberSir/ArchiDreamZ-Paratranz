Where did you come from here, #?
Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose. I think it's time for you to make money.
I don't trade with a stranger.
I have to go to the mine.
From the West? Are you a spy by chance?
The times are hard now. Enemies are everywhere, you must understand that you need trust. So far, I have no confidence in you.
A little bit later.
Don't poke me. Earn a reputation.
