Get out!
Get out! Look, I said!
You won't get anything from me.
Killer!
The door is over there, leave this place.
Don't force me.
Whose are you? From the East? Or from the North? That there, that there are murderers and bastards.
I'll call security right now.
Do not think that I am helpless, I have a surprise under the bench for people like you.
I trained for the fight for a reason. Well attack.
People like you are not liked here.
Get out. Okay, I'm waiting.
