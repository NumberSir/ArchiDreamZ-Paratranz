Welcome, #! How can I serve?
The best booze in all of Middle-earth!
Would you like some gnomish ale? You are to the north.
I suggest you drink.
Where are you from, #?
You look friendly.
Dwarfs come to me sometimes, but not very often. I love to hear their stories.
Are you tired, #? Do you want a drink? Excellent cider today! Just try it.
How many orcs have you killed?
Will you tell me about the far lands?
Easterlings are our irreconcilable enemies. They could have served a good cause, but they chose the Dark path. Well, okay, what I mean about the bad. Let's drink, #!
Someday I will visit Gondor. I want to taste their ale. Did you know # that everyone's ale is different?
The wood elves have fine wine. But I know where it comes from. Dorvi .... Sorry, the tongue came loose.
It seems enough for me today ...
Wow, the main thing is not to overdo it. I still have kind people to serve.
