Many years have passed since the day Bard the Archer killed Smaug, #, and a lot has changed since then!
Welcome to Dale, #!
Dalish markets have seen many different antiques from all over the world. You will not find better prices and goods than in Dale!
The wealth of the mountain has brought us not only prosperity, but also misfortune ... I hope this will not happen again.
Few of the living remember what the dragon looked like. After all, this fight took place back in the days when Dale was on fire.
Have you ever tried Dalish cakes, #? They are the tastiest in the whole world!
Dale's merchants travel long and far to bring us many rare goods.
What can I do for you, #? Travelers are welcomed here with open arms.
Hi stranger! Welcome to the Kingdom of Dale!
Some of us still remember how Bard killed the cursed dragon with his black arrow. This is admirable!
These lands have flourished since the dragon was slain.
Our land is not so fertile, but it can give a rich harvest.
You should have seen, #, my last year's pumpkin ... The whole Dale was jealous.
The onions are especially good this year!
I do not need fertilizers, for there is a stable nearby. The groom and I are friends. Manure just gives away.
