As you can see,#, my feet are already aching to carry this heavy load. But You can help me and buy something.
Leaving? Can you buy something?
We dwarves don't usually trade with humans, but you are an exception,#.
Ale, armor, weapons are yours, my friend! As long as you have enough coins ...
Other Nations can't boast the riches that our mountains hide.
I travel the lands in search of wealth. Perhaps You are doing the same,#?
Give me a few coins, # and I will be the happiest merchant in the world!
Hi,#! Do you want to buy my products?
I have brought the great treasures of the dwarves! You can get them for... symbolic fee. For example, 50 coins?
Do you want to trade with me,#? I have several products that may attract Your attention.
I won't give anything away for free!
You want to trade with me,#? For a couple of dozen silver coins, you can enjoy the art of our people!
Until you have tasted our food, You have not lived,#. fortunately, I have some here!
I can see the hunger in your eyes,#. Have you tasted the delicious food of the dwarves?
We are dwarves, and our art is unsurpassed.
