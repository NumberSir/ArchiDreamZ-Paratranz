You must prove your loyalty if you want to hire some of our brave warriors,#.
I can't trust everyone I meet with my guys
You must earn my trust before I can allow you to command my dwarves.
Prove your loyalty to the clan Stiffbeards, and we will follow you!
You can only hire my men after you've made a name for yourself among the dwarves of Baraz-tum
The dwarves will only follow someone they can trust into battle!
Show your loyalty to our people, and only then will the dwarves follow you!
You want to hire dwarves? First you must prove your loyalty to our people!
My boys won't be the warriors of everyone they meet.
Who are you? I haven't heard of you. Kill a few traitors and orcs, then we'll talk!
