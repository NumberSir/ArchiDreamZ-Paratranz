Do you have any coins, friend?
My bags are full of precious ores!
Fresh meat without bones! I'd pay a hefty bag of silver for it ...
Do you have some ale,#?
Want to trade,#?
I pay handsomely for a good drink!
By my beard, I'm starving!
Want to trade, #? 
I have a lot of valuable ores to sell.
I would give anything for a delicious piece of juicy meat!
By my beard, we are starving in the mines here!
I would give all my gold now for just one glass of dwarven ale!
You're a bit tall for these mines, aren't you,#?
Good day,#! Or is it night? I don't know. I've been working in these mines for ages!
Hi,#! You want to trade with me? I have many different ores that will satisfy your desires.
My beard is one big mine! Heh-heh-heh-heh!
