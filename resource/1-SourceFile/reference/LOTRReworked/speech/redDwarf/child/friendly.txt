Welcome to us, #!
You are not from the Red Mountains. 
Greetings! 
Soon I'll be able to drink dwarf ale. I can't wait!
Even my mother's beard is better than yours,#!
Can you give me dwarf ale while no one is looking? 
How are you, #? 
Aaaarrrrgh! 
They say I'm too young to hunt orcs! Ha!
I would like to wear my father's armor ... one
Day, I will have a big beard! 
There is no finer weapon than the dwarf axe,#! one
Day I will fight the orcs, side by side with my father.
