I am proud to fight for your cause,#!
Avenge Snape's eye!
The eye itches, they say, it's for a fight
Crush your enemies like annoying insects!
The axes of the dwarves are sharpened and ready to cut, #!
Few in middle-earth can resist our might!
That's all well and good, but I'm so thirsty!
Never have I fought shoulder to shoulder with such a good warrior as you, #
Baruk-Khazad!
Enemies will shudder and fall!
There is no traitor who will survive the blow of my axe!
By my beard, I would fight a dragon to drink ale!
My axe-death to the enemy!
For The Red Mountains!
