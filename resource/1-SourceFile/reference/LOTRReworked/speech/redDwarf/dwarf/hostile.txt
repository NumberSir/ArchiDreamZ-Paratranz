Don't expect anything good, dwarves don't like traitors!
You are no match for the Steefbeards!
Get away,#!
I'll turn you into a pancake!
Come on, #! Show me what you can do!
Feel the wrath of the dwarves!
Why did you come here? Do you want to turn into a pancake?
Get out, you creep!
This is your last hour, #!
No! Dwarf ale is not for you!
Die!
I will crush you like a stone!
You underestimate the power of the Red Mountains, #!
Vile overgrowth!
What were you thinking, getting into a fight with me?
Woe and destruction to you and your people, #!
Khazâd ai-mênu!
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
You'll die, by the beard!
How dare you touch our land with your paws?
Get out, you bastard!
You will pay for selling your soul to the Dark Lord!
